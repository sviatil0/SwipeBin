<h1> Planned functionality for version 1</h1>
<p>
1. User starts a script and chooses a source forlder. <br>
2. The script creates two folders in the source folder "remove" and "maybe" <br>
3. The script goes through each file in the source folder and previews it. It asks whether to remove the file (swipe left by clicking left-arrow) leave the file be (swipe right by clicking rightarrow) move the file to a new destination (TOP-arrow), or undo the last command (bottom arrows). <br>
